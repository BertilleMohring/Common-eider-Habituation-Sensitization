## Overview

This repository contains the data used in the following manuscript: Mohring B, Angelier F, Jaatinen K, Steele B and Öst M (2024) Habituation or sensitization? Short-term adjustment of flight initiation distance in incubating common eiders. Animal Behavior. (accepted)

## Data
The dataset "_dataHabituationSensitization.csv_" contains the data used in the manuscript to look at adjustments of female common eider flight initiation distance to repeated human approaches. The variables are as follows:
* _Year_: Year of the study (range: 2009-2023).
* _Ring_: ID of female common eiders.
* _ID_YearBird_: Unique ID for a bird-year (unique breeding attempt ID).
* _FID_: Flight initiation distance (in cm, to the nearest 10 cm).
* _FID_nb_: Trial number (range 1-6).
* _Island_ID_: Island ID.
* _Island_type_: Island type: open or forested.
* _Breed_exp_: Female minimum breeding experience (in years)
* _Body_condition_: Female body condition index (see manuscript for details of the calculation of the body condition index)
* _ClutchSize_: Clutch size
* _Eagle_index_: annual index of white-tailed eagle abundance in the study area during the eiders’ reproductive season (from April 1 to June 15).
This index was calculated, for each year, as the average daily number of white-tailed eagle sightings between April 1 and June 15 at the nearby (ca 20 km) Hanko Bird Observatory (HALIAS, 59°49′N, 22°54′E).
* _Ad_pred_risk_: Island-specific adult predation risk, proportion of breeding females found killed on an island for a given year (see methods for further details on how this index was obtained)
* _Nest_pred_risk_: Island-specific nest predation risk, proportion of depredated nest on an island for a given year (see methods for further details on how this index was obtained)
* _Laying_date_: Laying date (1 corresponds to April 1 each year).
